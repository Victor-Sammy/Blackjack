### How to score in Blackjack
Blackjack hands are scored by their point total. The hand with the highest total wins as long as it does not exceed 21; a hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and face cards( JACK, QUEEN, KING ) are also worth 10.
